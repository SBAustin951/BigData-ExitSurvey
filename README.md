# BigData-ExitSurvey
Design and implementation of senior exit survey

Design and Implement a web-based senior exit survey system for VSU CS program. Your survey system should support at least the following features: 

  Provide a login interface for a user to log in as administrator (need to enter admin username and password correctly)

  Any guest may complete this survey. However, only administrator can access all the completed survey data, which are retrieved from the back-end MySQL database.

  A guest must provide her email address to submit the survey. Provide input validation for this.
  
  Provide a way for administrator to view all the survey data in the format of table.
  
  Provide a way for administrator to sort all the data entries in the order of timestamp, i.e., from the latest entry to the earliest entry.
  
  Provide a way for administrator to delete any specific survey entry due to its poor quality.
